To display the site, go to the button labeled either '<code>' or 'Code' and click.
In the dropdown menu, click 'download zip'.
Enter the downloaded file and open the HTML document in your browser.

After doing this, the file will be downloaded locally. Any changes made to
  the file after you have downloaded it will not be displayed on your machine,
  so you will have to redownload it to view an updated version.
